Use the `/tag` command to create, edit, remove, or list tags. You can also restrict tag usage to specific roles. Each tag has a 10-second cooldown per channel.

Using `/tag add` will open a menu to configure the embed sent when the tag is used. Alternatively, you can add content directly in the command option to send it as a regular message instead of an embed.

The prefix of the server changes how members use tags. You can change it using `/tag prefix`. If your prefix is `?`, typing `?rules` will send the **rules** tag. Tag commands are deleted after the tag is sent, if the message doesn't contain other content. The tag command doesn't have to be at the start of the message.
